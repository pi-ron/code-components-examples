# Test Component

A simple test component to verify Webflow Code Components import process.

## Getting Started
- Install dependencies: `npm i`
- Run locally: `npm run dev`
- Build: `npm run build`

## Import to Webflow
Since the CLI `library share` command is not available, use the Webflow Dashboard:
1. Go to Site Settings → Integrations
2. Find Code Components section
3. Upload the built component from the `dist` folder
